# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-K-Nearest-Neighbors
This project explores the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. KNN is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to other data points in the feature space.
