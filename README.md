This project explores the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. KNN is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to other data points in the feature space.

## **Handwritten Digit Recognition with K-Nearest Neighbors**

**Project Overview:**

This project explores the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. KNN is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to other data points in the feature space.

**Features or Highlights:**

- **MNIST Dataset:** The project utilizes the widely used MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **KNN Algorithm:** The KNN algorithm is implemented from scratch to understand its inner workings.
- **Accuracy Evaluation:** The model's accuracy is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The effect of different hyperparameters, such as the value of K, on the model's performance is explored.

**Tools and Libraries Used:**

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

**Installation and Usage Instructions:**

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`.
2. Download the MNIST dataset.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file to train and evaluate the KNN model.

**Results and Insights:**

The KNN model achieves a high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits. The optimal value of K is found to be 3, which balances bias and variance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Feature Engineering:** Explore different feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
- **Other Algorithms:** Compare KNN with other classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest.
